# PCA Digit Classifiers

**Abstract:**

In this paper we will classify images of digits. We perform PCA on both the train and test data
with k such that the low-dimensional reconstruction of the data from k-PC modes will retain 85% of the
energy. Then we project the data into k-modes PCA space and use Ridge, KNN, and SVM classifiers to
classify each image by digit, using cross-validation to tune hyper-parameters. We also restrict our data to
only images of certain digits and apply the same process. We then evaluate the accuracy of each classifier
on both the train and test data.
